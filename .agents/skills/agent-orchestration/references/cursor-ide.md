# Agent orchestration — Cursor IDE

A **premium orchestrator** (Grok 4.5, Fable 5, Sonnet 5, or GPT-5.6 Sol) plans in Cursor Agent chat. **Composer 2.5** workers run as subagents with explicit `model:` pins in `.cursor/agents/`.

Skills CLI does **not** install `.cursor/agents/` — run `init-cursor.sh` after `bunx skills add`.

---

## Bootstrap (one-time per repo)

```bash
bunx skills add FixMyBerlin/fixmyskills --skill agent-orchestration -a cursor -y
bash .agents/skills/agent-orchestration/scripts/init-cursor.sh
git add .cursor/agents .cursor/rules skills-lock.json
git commit -m "Add Cursor agent orchestration setup"
```

`TARGET_REPO=/path` overrides destination.

Reset templates: re-run `init-cursor.sh` (overwrites).

## Picking an orchestrator

| Model           | Good for                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Grok 4.5**    | Long-running, multi-step work; Cursor's first-party orchestrator (shares included usage pool with Composer). Not available in EU. |
| **Fable 5**     | Complex, long-running, multi-step agentic work; highest capability                                                                |
| **Sonnet 5**    | Everyday coding with strong multi-step reasoning and reliable tool use                                                            |
| **GPT-5.6 Sol** | Long-running agent work; can over-delegate on mid-sized tasks — keep one `/implementer` per cohesive task                         |

Workers stay on **Composer 2.5** regardless of orchestrator choice.

---

## Daily usage

1. Pick an orchestrator (Grok 4.5, Fable 5, Sonnet 5, or GPT-5.6 Sol).
2. Start large tasks with **`@orchestrator-worker`**:

```
@orchestrator-worker

Implement [feature]. You orchestrate only:
- explore for discovery
- /implementer for edits and tests
- /verifier before declaring done
Do not edit files yourself.
```

**Skip** trivial one-file edits — subagent startup costs more than inline work.

---

## Delegation

| Task                                       | Delegate to                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Codebase search                            | Built-in `explore`             |
| Edits, tests, installs, state-changing git | `/implementer`                 |
| Read-only diagnostics (logs, status)       | Built-in `bash`                |
| Post-change validation                     | `/verifier` (readonly)         |
| Browser / UI                               | `browser` or agent-browser MCP |

Invocation: `/implementer [scoped brief]`, `/verifier [what to prove]`. For parallel work, send multiple subagent Task calls in one message.

Orchestrator may inline only trivial fixes (~10 lines) or when user says "no subagents".

---

## Worker model pins

`.cursor/agents/` frontmatter: `model: composer-2.5[fast=false]`. Verifier adds `readonly: true`. **Avoid** `inherit` or omitted model — bills at your orchestrator's rate. Parallel subagents = parallel token spend.

Cursor may fall back from a pinned worker model when blocked by admin, unavailable Max Mode, or plan limits.

---

## Customize & verify

- Edit copied files in the target repo (`verifier.md` check commands, rule delegation for MCP, etc.). Do **not** put orchestration in global Cursor User Rules — use `@orchestrator-worker` per task.
- Verify: `@orchestrator-worker` in rule picker; `/implementer` and `/verifier` show `composer-2.5[fast=false]`; delegation prompt spawns workers instead of editing directly.
